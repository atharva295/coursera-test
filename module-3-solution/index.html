			Puran Poli

		<p>
			The various names for the flatbread include Holige or Obbattu in Kannada, Puran poli or Vedmi in Gujarati, Puran poli in Marathi, Uppittu in Malayalam and Tamil, Baksham or Bobbattu or Oliga in Telugu, Andhra Pradesh and Pole/Polae in Telangana, Ubbatti or simply Poli in Konkani <br>
			Holige is made from Channa, Plain flour (wheat flour), Jaggery or Cane Sugar, Cardamom powder and/or Nutmeg powder, Ghee and Water. Sometimes Toor dal is used in Gujarat. It is commonly used in the state of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu as well. In Andhra Pradesh and other places, Moong dal, Chana or a mix is used. Other ingredients that may or may not be used are: Nuts, Dates, Turmeric powder <br>
			To understand the nutritional value we need to look at the main contents of Puran Poli. As noted above, the predominant ingredients are Chana, Plain flour, Jaggery or Sugar. <br>
             
            1. Chana: It is a variant of Chickpea. It provides Fiber, is a major source of Protein, may help reduce Cholesterol and also contains Zinc, Folate and Calcium.[4]. Toor dal can be used in place of chana dal and it has similar properties as of Chana dal.
             <br>
            2. Plain flour, Jaggery or Sugar: These are the major sources of Carbohydrates. While plain flour adds Complex carbohydrates, Jaggery and Sugar are Simple carbohydrates.

			Modak
		</div>
		<p>
			Modak (Marathi: मोदक ) (Japanese: 歓喜団) is an Indian sweet popular in many parts of India. The sweet filling on the inside of a modak consists of freshly grated coconut and jaggery while the outer soft shell is made from rice flour or wheat flour mixed with khava or maida flour. It is used for Ganesha during prayers. <br>
			It is called modak (मोदक) in Marathi, Konkani and in Gujarati languages, modhaka in Kannada, modhakam or kozhakkattai in Tamil and kudumu in Telugu. <br>
			Modak is considered to be the favourite sweet of the Hindu deity, Ganesha.[2] It begets him the moniker modakapriya (one who likes modak) in Sanskrit. <br>
            During Ganesh Chaturthi, the puja usually concludes with an offering of 21 modaks to Ganesha as prasadam. Modaks made with rice flour shells are often preferred for this purpose, although wheat shell versions are also used. Local businesses outside Ganesh Temples across India usually sell pre-packed/readymade versions of Modaks. <br>
            In Japan, a sweet similar to modak and known locally as Kangidan (歓喜団), is offered to god Kangiten, the Japanese version of Lord Ganesha. Kangidans are made from curds, honey, and red bean paste. They are wrapped in kneaded dough made from parched flour and shaped like a bun before they are deep fried.

			Basundi
		</div>
		<p>
			Basundi (Gujarati: બાસુંદી, Kannada: ಬಾಸುಂಡಿ, Marathi: बासुंदी, Tamil: பாசந்தி, Telugu: బాసుంది) is an Indian sweet mostly in Gujarat, Maharashtra , Telangana and Karnataka. It is a sweetened condensed milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced by half. In North India, a similar dish goes by the name rabri. [check quotation syntax] It is often made on Hindu festivals such as Kali Chaudas and Bhaubeej (Bhai Dooj). <br>
			Different styles of basundi are also prepared, such as sitaphal (custard apple) basundi and angoor basundi (basundi with smaller kinds of rasgullas). <br>
			Heavy cream may be added during the boiling process to hasten the thickening process. Once reduced, a little sugar, cardamom, charoli and/or saffron are added. Basundi is preserved well after sugar is added. Sugar develops some acidity over a period of time. If it is excessive, then it can curdle the basundi. Sometimes after adding sugar, one cooks it for some more time; this gives a nice pink color to basundi, as sugar is also cooked in milk turning into a light caramel. Before adding sugar, basundi is thick, but after adding, it becomes fluid again. Stirring well prevents malai from being formed on top and all guests (even late comers) can enjoy equally thick and plain basundi. Basundi is served chilled, often garnished with slices of almonds and pistachios. Adding less saffron reduces colour intensity. The addition of condensed milk gives a nice flavour and richness to basundi <br>
